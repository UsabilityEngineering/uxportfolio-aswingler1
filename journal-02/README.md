# Contactless Payment During the Pandemic
## Albert Swingler. March 29, 2020

I guess I go to Safeway a lot since this journal entry is also about an experience I had at Safeway but this time it was in the store rather than at the pump. As we are all trying our best these days to avoid contact with other people and commonly touched items, I decided to use Apple Pay when I went to Safeway this weekend in order to avoid having to exchange cash with the employee at the register and touch the payment terminal as little as possible. Because my credit/debit card information is on my watch I am able to hold that near the terminal when it is time to pay to complete the transaction.

Being able to do this to pay was **safe**, **efficient**, **satisfying**, and **learnable**. It was safe because I was able to complete the transaction without having to touch the terminal that had already been used by hundreds of people that day. It was efficient because it was faster than having to take my wallet out and insert my card in the chip reader, wait a few seconds, take my card out and put my wallet away. All I had to do was push the side button on the watch and hold it by the terminal for a second. It was satisfying because it was a faster way to pay and was less hassle for me because I didn't have to get anything out of my pocket. It was also learnable because it requires fewer steps to pay with Apple pay than it does to pay with a physical card like we're all used to. Overall it was a nice experience and could have saved me from getting sick.
